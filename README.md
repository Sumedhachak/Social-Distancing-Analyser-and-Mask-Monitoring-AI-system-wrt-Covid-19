# Live Social Distance Monitoring and Face Mask Detection AI Solution for Covid-19

## Tata Innoverse Solver Hunt 8 Hackathon

### This project proposes a computer vision based AI system to check whether social distancing is being maintained in crowded place or at any place (eg: market, or workplace) coupled with Mask detection system to track people who are wearing masks. This solution can be used in CCTV cameras and other video surveillance systems. While the data; such as the number of people in the vicinity, the number of people violating social distancing, and not wearing face-masks; has been used for analysis.
